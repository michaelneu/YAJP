# Jit

The main goal of this assignment was to create a basic CVS similar to git, which allows the user to add files to a staging tree - basically a merkle tree - and to create and checkout commits. 

### Additional features

Sourcing the `jit-setup` file the Jit commands are available as follows: 

```
$ . jit-setup
$ Jit add file.txt
$ Jit staging
```
